CSS COLORS:
Hexidecimal colors are three groups: red, green and blue.

BOX PRINCIPLES IN CSS
======================
BLOCK AND INLINE ELEMENTS
    -Block elements use full width of browser window and enfore line breaks.
    -Inline elements don't do any of that. (Images, links). Can neither set their height or width.

CLEARFIX HACK
    -make empty div as such: <div class="clearfix"></div> in HTML
    -.clearfix:after {
    content: "";
    display: table;
    clear: both;
}
    **Put this in the stylesheet**

POSITIONING
    -Absolute
        -parent needs to be relative position, container is set to absolute, in reference to the parent.
    -Relative

DESIGN PRINCIPLES
=================
    FONTS
        -Use a font between 15-25px for body text.
        -Use large font sizes for headlines
        -Use line spacing between 120 and 150%
        -Only put 45-90 characters per line
        -Use sans-serif fonts as often as possible, unless your site is word-heavy, like a blog. Try to keep it to one font, two at most. Check e-book for font-pairing practices.
    COLORS
        -Use only one base color, staying away from black, white and gray.
        -'Flat UI Colors' offers great base colors.
        -Use a color wheel tool if you want to use color combinations. 'Adobe CC Color' is a good tool for this.
        -Use color to draw attention to important buttons or tools.
        -Do not use black in your design.
        -Choose colors wisely
            -red: for power/ passion/ excitement
            -orange: for attention yet less overpowering
            -yellow: curiosity and intelligence energetic and happiness
            -green: is harmony, nature life and health, can harmonize and balance designs
            -blue: patience, piece, stability, trust and honor
                -think all big social networking
            -purple: powerful, wealth, wisdom, royalty
            -pink: romance, passivity, care and affection
            -brown: relaxation and confidence, earthiness: nature, durability, comfort and reliability
    IMAGES
        -Put text directly on an image, so long as you have a healthy contrast between image and text. Some tricks below:
            -Solution is to overlay image with a color, typically black, making the overall image darker. But other colors can be used, as well as gradients. Check the e-book for help.
            -Put text in a box when putting it over images. Box should be opaque, so you can still see the image beneath it. Or make the box black.
            -Blur the image or make it out of focus.
            -Floor fading is good: darken image at the bottom, proceeding into the bottom navbar.
        **check e-book for image resources** 
    ICONS
        -Use to show features or steps within the site.
        -Also good for actions and links
            -make them instantly recognizable
            -label them
            -do not let them take center-stage in a design
                -don't cover everything with icons, give them a supporting roll.
        -use icon fonts whenever possible, vector-icons scale crystal clear regardless of the sizes
        **check e-book for resources for free icons**
    SPACING+LAYOUT
        -WhiteSpace
            -space where there is nothing, integral to good layouts
            -put whitespace between elements, groups of elements, and sections. But do not exaggerate because parts of your site might lose relation to each other.
                -describes invisible relationships between the elements of your website.
            Visual Heirarchy
                -Define where you want your audience to look first
                -Establish a flow that corresponds with your contents' message
                -Use whitespace to build that flow
    INTRO TO USER EXPERIENCE
        -User Interface (what we've covered so far)
            -the presentation of the product, how it looks and feels
        -User Experience
            -the overall expereince the user has with the product
            -interface vs experience: think of the old and new Heinz Ketchup bottles
            -UX is when User's Goals and Businesses' Goals come together
        **link in e-book to UX crash course**
    INSPIRATION
        -use other websites as inspiration to see what leading designers are doing right.
            -collect designs you like/ think are well designed
            -answer the questions as to why you like them
            -figure out what they have in common
            -use chrome dev tools to break em apart and put em back together
        -steal like an artist
        **check e-book for resources, like dribble.**
